- Expanding rings (life spreading)
- Growing stems (roots deepening)
- Scaling effects (thriving ecosystem)

### 3. **Natural Elements** 🌍
- ☀️ Sun with rays (energy source)
- 🌱 Sprout (new life)
- 🍃 Floating particles (seeds in wind)
- 🌿 Leaf patterns (foliage)
- 💚 Green color scheme (nature)

### 4. **Energy & Life** ⚡
- Pulsing animations (heartbeat)
- Glowing effects (life force)
- Orbiting elements (ecosystem)
- Light rays (photosynthesis)
- Continuous rotation (life cycle)

### 5. **Sustainability Message** ♻️
